    "Jo達o is a farmer from a small town who specializes in growing wheat, corn and sugar beet. He owns $500 km^2$ of land and must decide the amount of land to be allocated to each of the crops. Jo達o faces several restrictions regarding his planting. First, he must have at least $200 T$ of wheat and $240 T$ of corn to feed his cattle. Such quantities can be obtained through own plantation or by buying from the city's cooperative. The purchase prices per ton of wheat are $238 R\\$/T$ and per ton of corn $210 R\\$/T$. On the other hand, any excess produced in relation to the minimum can be sold at the cooperative, however with a $40\\%$ discount on the purchase price ($170 R\\$/T$ for wheat and $150 R\\$/T$ for corn) per the cooperative's margin account. Another important restriction concerns the sale of sugar beet. By law, the sale price of a ton of beet at the cooperative is fixed at $36 R\\$/T$ for the first $6000 T$ sold. After this amount, the sale price becomes $10 R\\$/T$. In addition, the cooperative where Jo達o trades his products does not have sugar beet for purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the planting cost of each crop is: $150 R\\$/km^2$ for wheat, $230 R\\$/km^2$ for corn, and $260 R\\$/km^2$ for sugar beet. The uncertainty of the problem lies in the productivity of the land. Jo達o does not know a priori how much each $km^2$ of land will yield in tons of culture. Now assume that three scenarios of equal probabilities of occurrence were sampled: \"good\", \"average\" and \"poor\". In each of the states, the yield of each crop is given by:\n",
    "\"Bad\" state: Wheat = $2 T/km^2$; Corn = $2.4 T/km^2$; Beetroot = $16 T/km^2$;\n",
    "\"Average\" state: Wheat = $2.5 T/km^2$; Corn = $3.0 T/km^2$; Beetroot = $20 T/km^2$;\n",
