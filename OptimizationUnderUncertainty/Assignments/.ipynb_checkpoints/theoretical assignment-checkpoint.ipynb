This $x$ amount is limited upwards by a $u$ value, as the newsboy has finite purchasing power. The decision is made under uncertainty since the demand  $d$  newspapers of the day is unknown. The number of $y$ newspapers is sold at a price of $q$ per unit. The newsboy also has an agreement with the newspaper editor: the number of unsold newspapers $w$ can be returned to the editor, who pays a $r$ price for him.\n",
